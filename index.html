								<h2>1.0 INTRODUCTION</h2>
							</div>
					<p>There were always creators, inventors, geniuses through the history of the humanity. Some did actually create, but for some it started with an idea and it stayed as an idea. We could define few problematics to the question of why it didn’t go beyond the idea and why it didn’t turn into a real thing. The biggest problem may be the funding. Indeed, this question is one of the first one people have to deal with. The creators started to find a way to get money for their projects and that’s how they turned to big money makers and very rich people to help them make their dreams happened. If they had a very good idea, something that could answer to some people’s problems, then the rich people would invest on the project. That’s how these people became the investors. As you are working with someone else money, you had to give reports and give to the investors lots of charts and numbers, and results. Somehow you were working for someone and not for yourself. Then the technology got better and better over the years. People started to have more and more ideas, projects and dreams but they also didn’t want to work for an investor anymore. But the funding problems were still present. That’s when startup started to rise and crowdfunding platforms got into the ocean of websites and started to also rise. That’s how creators, inventors, dreamers started to work without the trouble of having a direct investor. That’s also how people started to believe in the same project and decided to contribute to achieve it. People started to believe that working together, in the same direction, and believing in something is a way to achieve big projects. But the creators, inventors, had another problem which is the deadline. The deadline is putting another pressure to the creators, and that’s how the creators are facing another hardship. Then technology got better and better, that’s how cryptocurrency got its way into our world.</p>

Fundition introduce a new way to fund projects. The concept of some actions, turned into currency has proven its feasibility and capability as seen on Steem Apps ecosystem.</p>
					<p>And we are proud to announce one of our best feature which is the possibility to Donate one Time to support lifetime.
							Advantages of Fundition compared to others platforms:
							- No fees for Donations as Fundorz (User with Steem account) instead of the 5%-15% fee ranges for other platform.

										<h2>2.0 CROWDFUNDING</h2>
									</div>
									<p>Around the year 2010, the start-up industry saw some incredible changes. Companies financial method and projects tend to lean towards the decentralization and the diversification of the public’s way of financing. The risk capital is losing its part meanwhile the crowdfunding is mobilizing capitals at a faster pace.  In the meantime, the new blockchain technology allows the start-up to raise funds in a more independent and decentralized way.
											With more than 900% growth between 2015 and 2017 in some countries, crowdfunding confirms a sustainable position in alternative funding. Nowadays, millions of funders are participating in project success using these kind platforms, and with a total of 182 million monthly visitors only for the 3 biggest platforms (kickstarter.com 46M + gofundme.com43M + patreon.com93M) which the growth rate of this market is in full swing.

										<h3>2.1 CROWDFUNDING REVENUE MODEL</h3>
									</div>
							<p>Crowdfunding projects have generated billions of dollars in the recent years, filling up centralized platform’s pockets, who continue to take huge fees for minimal services and they didn’t evolve since the start. However, without these many project’s creators and donators most of these projects will remain a dream and these platforms would not exist.</p>
